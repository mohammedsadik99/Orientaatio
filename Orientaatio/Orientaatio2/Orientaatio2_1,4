a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?
To model ongoing arrivals in a system, a new arrival event is scheduled to ensure a continuous flow of entities (e.g., customers) over time. This simulates real-world scenarios where entities keep arriving at irregular intervals.

b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?
The completion of service event should be generated. It schedules when the current service will end, allowing the system to manage the transition and handle subsequent events, such as starting service for the next customer.

4. Three-Phase Simulation Example: Call Center
Initialization: Set up events for client arrivals and exits, including clients of type X and Y.
Processing: Process events in order. Handle arrivals by adding to queues and exits by checking if the client is type Y.
Termination: Stop the simulation when a client of type Y exits.
Example:

Add events like "Client X arrives" and "Client Y exits".
Process events until "Client Y exits" is encountered, then terminate.
This ensures the simulation runs until a client of type Y exits the system.
